# Matrix_Multiplier_Program
This is a Matrix Multiplier program I wrote in my Intro to Java class (CSC 3020) at WSU.

The user is asked to enter the number of rows and columns for 2 matricies. Both the matricies are filled with random values and then they are multiplied.
The output is the product of the two matricies. Enjoy :)
